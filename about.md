title: About
---

I am an undergraduate student at [Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur](http://mnit.ac.in/). I expect to graduate with a Bachelors degree in May 2016.

I am obsessed with learning and making things. I love programming and tinkering with electronics. Especially, I love to work in the area of Robotics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Currently, I am contributing to [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a Python based Machine learning library and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), a real-time Computer Vision library. In my free time, you will generally find me playing the guitar or watching movies. 

Basically, I am a person with many interests and will use this website to write about these and share what I learn. Thank you for visiting, I hope that you will find something that ignites your interest in something new!
