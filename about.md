I am a final year B.Tech student at Malaviya National Institute of Technology. I am a programmer and
and an electronic hobyist. I love to work in the area of Robotics, Machine learning, Computer Vision 
and Image processing. Besides these I also do competitive programming. Currently, I am contributing
to [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), a Python based Machine learning 
library.

I want to use this website to blog about my projects and interests.
