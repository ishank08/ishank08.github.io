I am a final year B.Tech student at [Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur](http://mnit.ac.in/). I am a programmer
and an electronics hobbyist. I love to work in the area of Robotics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Besides these I also do competitive programming. Currently, I am contributing
to [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), a Python based Machine learning 
library.

I want to use this website to blog about my projects and interests.
