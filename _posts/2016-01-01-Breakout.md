In this project I have written a clone of Breakout game released by Atari Incorporated for Android phones and tablets.

## Implementation

You can have a look at my code [here](https://github.com/IshankGulati/Breakout/tree/master/Android%20Studio%20project/Breakout). To try the game simply download the .apk file from [this](https://github.com/IshankGulati/Breakout/tree/master/APK%20file) link.

## How to run

Install breakout.apk from APK file directory. Touch the left or right side of screen to move the paddle in the corresponding direction.

## Additional Dependencies

Just an Android phone.

## Credits

I have followed the tutorials at [gamecodeschool.com](gamecodeschool.com). In addition to tutorials I have implemented :

* A common interface for all the game objects.
* Main menu, End game menu and Splash screen.
* Backgroud music and Sound effects.
