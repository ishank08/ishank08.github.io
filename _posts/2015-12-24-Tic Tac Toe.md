This is basically the same old school single player Tic Tac Toe game developed in Python using Pygame. Actually this is the first game that I wrote, so the interface is a bit sloppy but still playable. I have used Minimax algorithm for AI that makes game unbeatable. [This](http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax) is a great tutorial to read more about Minimax algorithm. To learn Pygame, [this](http://thepythongamebook.com/en:pygame:start) is slightly outdated but still a great tutorial. If you prefer video tutorials than [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAjkwJocj7vlc_mFU-4wXJq) is also a good one.

## Tools

[Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.

## Implementation

I won't be embedding my code here as it is quite lengthy, you can refer my [repository](https://github.com/IshankGulati/Tic-Tac-Toe) for complete code.

# Additional Dependencies

Yeah, Python 2.7 and Pygame.

Thanks!
