In this project I have written a clone of [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) game for Android phones and Tablets.

## Implementation

You can have a look at my code [here](https://github.com/IshankGulati/Space-Invaders/tree/master/Android%20Studio%20project/SpaceInvaders). To try the game simply download the .apk file from [this](https://github.com/IshankGulati/Breakout/tree/master/APK%20file) link.

## How to run

Install SpaceInvaders.apk from APK file directory. Touch the left or right side of screen to move the player ship in the corresponding direction. Press the red button to shoot bullets.

## Additional Dependencies

Just an Android phone.

## Credits

I have followed the tutorials at [gamecodeschool.com](gamecodeschool.com). In addition to tutorials I have implemented :

* A common interface for all the game objects.
* Main menu, Pause menu, End game menu and Splash screen.
* A button to shoot bullets.
* Backgroud music and Sound effects.
